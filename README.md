There are several types of pages planned for the website. The types are:
* blogpost
* project
* archive
* remote
These will be documented with an example in the `_drafts` folder. Remote pages are not actually displayed, they are used only to refer to other websites; Blogposts are simple pages that contain something we write; projects are intended to document *active* projects; archive is intended for projects that are no longer maintained by us (and typically explains why/where the data can be found, etc). 

To create a new page:  
Copy the file `_drafts/TYPE-template.html` to `_posts` and call it `yyyy-mm-dd-title.ext` (year, month, day, title, extension). Extension is normally html or markdown.
Fill out the template as described in that file.

For remote pages, note that the content is used as a description. For all other page types, a click-able post title will appear.
